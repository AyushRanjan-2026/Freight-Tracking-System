Designed and implemented a smart contract-based logistics platform using the Truffle Suite and Solidity to manage freight deliveries securely and transparently. The platform's features include a mechanism for registering vehicles with specific capacities, scheduling trips with defined origins and destinations, and assigning vehicles to trips. The core functionality uses an escrow system where funds are locked in the smart contract until a trip is marked as successfully delivered. The project also demonstrates an understanding of modern DApp development by leveraging a Web3.js client-side application for user interaction and wallet integration.
